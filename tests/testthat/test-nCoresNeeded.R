## The DEoptim cluster's size is also its population size: clusters:::.clusterNP() sets NP to the
## number of workers the cluster was built with, discarding any NP the caller asked for. So the only
## way to choose NP is to choose the cluster size, which is `nCoresNeeded` in
## fireSenseUtils::runDEoptim() -- and this module never passed it, so the package default
## (10 * length(lower), i.e. 120 for a 12-parameter fit) always won.
##
## FireSense phase 2 (2026-09-16): measured per-ELF, a generation costs the SLOWEST of NP evaluations,
## and the expected maximum barely moves with NP (68.0 s at NP 120 vs 64.9 s at NP 60 for ELF 4.1).
## Throughput therefore comes from running more ELFs at once, not from shorter generations: at 704
## cores, NP 60 allows 11 concurrent fits where NP 120 allows 5. Choosing NP needs it to be a
## parameter of this module.
