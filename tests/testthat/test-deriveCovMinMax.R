## deriveCovMinMax(): the ranges that rescale covariates, in the fit and again in prediction.
## Fuel biomass columns get the FIXED range fireSenseUtils::fuelLinearRange, c(0, 1e4), so rescaling is
## biomass / 1e4 in every polygon and every predicted year; a data-derived maximum would differ between
## polygons and would have to be the fitted polygon's, forever. Every other covariate keeps its own range.
