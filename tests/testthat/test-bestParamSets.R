## The ledger's parameter sets for an ELF.
##
## FireSense, 2026-09-17: the ledger's "5 best" were five copies of one member. The run event took the 5
## GENERATIONS with the lowest best value, and those generations all hold the same frozen best member --
## itself usually a lucky draw (ranked 1st to 6th of 60 by replicated mean in eight fits). The ledger also
## never stored covMinMax_spread, which prediction needs to rescale covariates.

## a DEoptim result: one element per generation; the last holds the final population and its values
