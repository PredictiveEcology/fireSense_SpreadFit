## runSpreadWithoutDEoptim() drew its own seed with `sample(1e6, 1)`, so the SNLL threshold it
## returns was different on every run. That is not merely untidy: the threshold becomes the `thresh`
## argument to runDEoptim(), so it is part of every cached DEoptim generation's key. A single cache
## miss on the estimateThreshold event therefore re-drew the threshold and invalidated EVERY cached
## generation for that ELF.
##
## Observed on 2026-09-16: 4.2.2 was interrupted and restarted; its threshold went 1236 -> 1416 and
## it recomputed from generation 1, losing ~17 h. 4.1 was interrupted the same way, hit the
## estimateThreshold cache, kept threshold 1705, and replayed 797 cached generations in ~35 min.
##
## A seed derived from the ELF makes the threshold reproducible, so a miss costs only the threshold
## recompute rather than the whole fit. The seed is an argument, so it is part of the Cache key --
## which is what test-thresholdCacheKey.R asks for: nothing that changes the result is omitted.
