#' How many forks the threshold self-calibration may use
#'
#' `mcmapply()` forks this process. Each child starts as a copy-on-write image
#' of the parent and diverges as R's garbage collector marks the heap, so the
#' honest per-child budget is the parent's own R heap, not a fixed 5000 MB: on
#' 2026-09-07 the forks of a ~90 GB parent each reached ~37 GB of private
#' memory within minutes. There is no floor above one. The previous
#' `max(4L, ...)` forced four such children per simulation whatever the host
#' had left and whatever `options(mc.cores)` said; three simulations doing that
#' on one host exhausted 1 TB.
#'
#' Threads already busy on the host reduce the CPU budget only. The previous
#' code subtracted them from the minimum of every budget, which on a shared
#' host went negative and landed back on the floor.
#'
#' @param heapMB numeric; R heap in use in this process, MB (`sum(gc()[, 2])`).
#' @param availMB numeric or `NULL`; memory available on the host, MB.
#'   Unknown (`NULL`, empty, non-finite) means one fork.
#' @param nPars integer; number of parameter sets to evaluate.
#' @param detCores integer; `parallel::detectCores()`.
#' @param activeThreads integer; busy threads already running on the host.
#' @param mcCores integer or `NULL`; `getOption("mc.cores")`, an explicit cap.
#' @return integer, at least 1.
